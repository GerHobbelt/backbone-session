##Backbone Session

A uniform approach to session control for backbon.js apps. 


## Install 

Using Bower: 
```
bower install backbone.session
```


## Conventions

There are a few things the plugin takes for granted and it's good to note: 

* Prefered api URL is "/session" (on the same domain)
* Prefered store is localStorage
